sort the 8 heap
why?
	because the way I'm doing it, ive log(8) == 3 misses every time (and 8 checks) i fix down
	instead, ill have only 1 check, .5 misses, and everything else just shuffles down as that'll be the biggest there (wont even have to sort it)

disadvantages:
	fixup become much longer - at the moment its practically free
	we could do it while its still in the cache
		when the last item of the 8 is shifted into, thats when we sort them.
		then at the end we sort all the ones in the bottom row
		we could count out when its going to happen so it can be unrolled :)


implementation
	we do the sorting in the fix up stage
		dont sort after the first swap, cause we dont want to ort right on the bottom




its not going to work, but its an idea:
	as we fix up, the new final new parent is shifted left

	when we shift it away, the structure of the tree is broken
		it will shift a larger item to its new place, and one of the children may be larger than this
		so no chance
