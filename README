There are 4 sets of tests: hardware performance counters, testing the sorts to
see if they work, simplescalar and software branch predictors.

Not that all scripts are expected to be run from the scripts directory:

cd scripts/
run_script

not:
scripts/run_script

main.c:

Enter the code directory. In main.c there are a list of sorts to be tested (look
for test_sort(). The
#defines TEST_MIN and TEST_MAX control how many keys are to be tested. The sorts
are tested for an array of every size between the min and max, also using that
size as a seed for the random number generator.

Some sorts do not work. Sorry. multi_quicksort and multi_quicksort_seq don't
always work, but they do with the sizes used in the other tests.

The #define RANDOM_SIZE controls time_sort() which gives a quick tick count or
how long it takes to run a sort. Not very official, at all. It also defines the
size of array used for the software predictors, which is official.

The #define RUN_VISUAL decides if the visual tests are being done. These were
used in development, and arent that interesting.

Hardware counters:

In the scripts directory, call do_all_papiex or do_all_perfex. You need a
patched kernel for this. See: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/.

Capture the output:
./do_all_papiex > my_results
Ctrl-C when bored, or needing results, as this will take a long time.

or
./do_all_perfex > my_results

If you use papiex (more accurate), then it needs to be converted
./papi_convert my_results > new_results

Then process the results to give you graphs:
./process_perfex_output new_results

Theres a little bit of hard coding in this script, so change $key_num to the
number of times perfex actually ran. Also modify the input so that only
completed work cycles are there. This means if the last sort you ran was
on2_selectsort, and it ran 256 times, but other sorts ran 257 times, remove the
other sorts from the results file.

This produces a file in the data/ directory called processes_cycles_data which
is in gnuplot format. If you add more sorts to the framework, you'll need to
edit the gnuplot scripts with the column numbers that are printed out.
