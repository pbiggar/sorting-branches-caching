base:

i:
- nlogn

c:
- significant increase once no longer in cache
- very good otherwise
- excellent temporal and spatial localitya

= stop presses, best result

cache:

i: 
- nlogn
- but more than base
= but it sint, exactly the same

- faster than base
+= nope


c:
- significant increase once no longer in cache, not as bad as base
= bang on

b:
= fewer misses due to fewer comparitive sorts


multi-seq:

i:
- 50% more than cache
- 

c:
- 4 per block
= nearly

b:

- branches increae with instruction count


multi-bin:

i:
- 25% more than cache

b:
- significant increase in mispredictions
= 2-level predictor adapts to it
