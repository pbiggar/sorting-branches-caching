i:

c:
- regular
- no spatial reuse
- no temporal reuse
- not terrible though


- onlogn
= yup


b:

- log{5/11}{N} misprediction
= exactly

total:
- onlogn
= yup

= slightly steeper slope than a NlogN

improved:
- lower instruction count
= 10% lower
- same cache misses
= slightly fewer
- same mispredictions
= slightly fewer

= much faster as a result (between 70 and 35% faster)


comparisons:
= twice as fast as heapsort
= twice as slow as quicksort
