i:

- increasing d reduces instructions
- 8 performs better than 4
= not true, 8 performs worst
+= means line is drawn between things from expected

- 4 performs better than base
= true

c:

- 8 heap should ahve best cache
- then 4
- then base
=yup, all true

= base keeps going for a step longer, as its in place
does lamarca have this?

b:

- 8 heap slightly more predictable
+= nope, less predictable. doesnt have the warmup that you get in selection sort

overall:

lamarca is right

predictor results:

* predictions go in a curve
