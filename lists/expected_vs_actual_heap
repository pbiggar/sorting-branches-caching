i:

- increasing d reduces instructions
- 8 performs better than 4
= not true, 8 performs worst
= obviously, as the height decreases at different rate than the decvrease in comparisons

= means line is drawn between things from expected

- 4 performs better than base
= true

c:


- lamarca says cache one has half the misses
= true

- 8 heap should ahve best cache
- then 4
- then base
=yup, all true

+= base keeps going for a step longer, as its in place does lamarca have this?

- base has poor temporal locality
= very true

- 

b:

- 8 heap slightly more predictable
= nope, less predictable. doesnt have the warmup that you get in selection sort

overall:

lamarca is right

predictor results:

* predictions go in a curve
