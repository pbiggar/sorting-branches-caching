algorithm n:

c: bad
+= same as base


algorithm s:

i:
- 15% lower than N
= true

c: bad
+= same as base

base:

i:

- 30% less than heapsort
= about the same as heapsort

- n logN
= truish

c:

b:

- ONlogN for all sorts
+=

tiled:

i:
= better than base

c:

b:

double-tiled:

i:
- same as tiled
= must be

c:
- level 1 greatly decreased
= true
- slight increase in level2
= not really
- overall slightly faster.
+= significantly

b:


multi:

i:
- large increase once the treshhodl hit,
= true, 50%

c:
- half a miss per keya
= true
- flatten out after the leap
= true
- lower fully assoc due to lack fo conflict misses
= false, direct mapped much better

b:


double-multi:

i:

c:

b:

= two level adaptive useful here
= due to access patterns
