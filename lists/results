overall:
*-  it takes a 4096 entry predictor to beat the bimodal (even the smallest)
*- due to replacement policy, direct mapped can beat fully associative
*- for 

on2 overall results:
- bubblesort faster than bubblesort2
- shakersort faster than bubblesorts and shakersort2
- insertion sort best, followed by selection

*on2 cache results:
- shakersort has temporal reuse
- insertion sort has very good temporal resuse
- generally bad reuse

on2 branch results:
*- insertion sort has 1 misprediction
*- selction sort has Hn+1 misprediction
*- selection sort is much worse in cache and instructions than shakersort, but much faster due to bubblesorts terrible branhc prediction


heap results:
*- base flat-lines for longer due to being in-place (not observed by lamarca)
*- predictions go in a curve
*- you might be better off using a semi-static predictor when dealing with random data



* new techniques
*: heapsort sentinel
- reorders the moves during the destruction of the heap in base heapsort so that a sentinel isnt required
